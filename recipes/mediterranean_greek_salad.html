    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Greek salad or horiatiki salad (Greek: χωριάτικη σαλάτα[a] or θερινή σαλάτα[b]) is a popular salad in Greek cuisine generally made with pieces of tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, green bell pepper slices, feta cheese (usually served as a slice on top of the other ingredients), and olives (typically Kalamata olives) and dressed with salt, Greek oregano, and olive oil. A common addition is caper berries (especially on the Dodecanese islands). Greek salad is often imagined as a farmer's breakfast or lunch, as its ingredients resemble those that a Greek farmer might have on hand.</p>
