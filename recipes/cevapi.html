    <h1>Croatian Cevapi Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../pictures/croatian_cevapi.webp">
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Ćevapi, ćevapčići is a grilled dish of minced meat found traditionally in the countries of southeast Europe (the Balkans).
    It is considered a national dish of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia [2] and is also common in Croatia,[3][4][5] Montenegro,
    Kosovo, North Macedonia and Slovenia. Ćevapi has its origins in the Balkans from before the Ottoman period[citation needed] ,
     and represents a regional speciality similar to the köfte kebab. They are usually served in groups of five to ten pieces on a
      plate or in a flatbread (lepina or somun), often with chopped onions, sour cream, kajmak (milk cream), ajvar (relish), and salt.
       Bosnian ćevapi are made from two types of minced beef meat, hand-mixed and formed with a funnel, while formed ćevapi are grilled.
        Serbian ćevapčići are made of beef, lamb or pork, or a mixture.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>

        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Steps:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine beef, veal, bread crumbs, onion, egg, soda water, seasoning blend, garlic, baking soda, paprika, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix well. Shape into small sausages and place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill sausages until browned, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>Use ground lamb or pork in the meat mixture if desired. You can shape the mixture into round patties for easier flipping.
     You can pan-fry the patties in oil instead of grilling them, if preferred.</p>
