    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p> Zucchini Fritters typically pan-fried in oil and their batter often includes a mixture of eggs, onion, dill, parsley, flour, and sometimes potatoes and cheese (beyaz peynir or kaşar). They are similar to Jewish latkes and potato pancakes from various cultures</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large zucchini, finely grated</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup sour cream, for topping</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Steps:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine zucchini and salt in a bowl and stir to combine. Set aside for 10 minutes. Pour mixture onto a clean dish towel or cheesecloth and squeeze to drain completely.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg in a bowl and add flour, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Stir in drained zucchini and mix well.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a medium-sized pan over medium-high heat. Add batter by the tablespoon. Cook fritters until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per batch. Transfer to a serving plate and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and salt. Serve immediately with sour cream.</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. Amount will vary depending on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and specific type of oil used.</p>
